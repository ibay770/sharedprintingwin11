Make shared printing work again in win11
Microsoft changed stuff, as usual, in their 24H2 updates so shareed printing doesn't work.
With the help of [these]([url](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/17fhq2y/windows_11_shared_printing_issue/)) people, changed some reg keys and it's working now.
this is just a registry file doing the work for you.
