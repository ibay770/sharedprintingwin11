Make shared printing/networking work again in win11
Microsoft changed stuff, as usual, in their 24H2 updates so shareed printing doesn't work.
Saw this on reddit, which mentioned some changed some reg keys and it's working now.
this is just a registry file doing the work for you.

Some printers still won't work, because Microsoft, they did say they are working on a fix, but the onoy "fix" is to go back to 23H2
